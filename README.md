## Summary
In this project, cans and bottles need to be classified using feature extraction. Classification is performed on cans, plastic, and glass bottles. The program is written in the Python programming language, and the main modules used for this project are OpenCV and scikitlearn. SIFT, SURF, and ORB algorithms are used to extract features on cans and bottles. The performance of ORB in feature detection is the same as with SIFT which means it is better than SURF and is faster by almost two orders of magnitude. The SVM algorithm is used to classify cans and bottles. The SVM algorithm tries to find the hyperplane with the largest possible margin between the support vectors. There are different kernels used by SVM algorithms, such as linear, RBF, and polynomial kernels.
